# Cryptocurrency Website

This repository contains the code for a simple cryptocurrency website that provides information about the current prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. The website features a responsive design and dynamic content fetching from the CoinGecko API.

## Description

The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the basic structure of the cryptocurrency website. It includes a navigation bar, a main content section with a call-to-action, and a list of cryptocurrency prices.

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for the website, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout.

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) uses jQuery to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API and updates the corresponding elements on the webpage dynamically.
